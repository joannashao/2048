# CPSC 210 Project

## Recreating the 2048 game

- **What will the application do?**

    This application is a *single-player sliding block game*. Users can slide and merge blocks that has the same value
    to create a new block with doubled value. A block with random small value appears every time the user slides a 
    block. Block values start from 2, and then 4, 8, 16, and so on.
 
    Users win the game once the value 2048 is reached, and lost the game once the whole game board is filled up with
    blocks and cannot merge anymore.

- **Who will use it?**

    People who are looking for a new game to play will use it, although anyone can use it since it is a simple
    entertaining game.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

    This game was very popular a few years ago, and I really loved playing it. Therefore I would love to recreate it
    and even add my own twist to it.
